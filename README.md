# Password-Generator

A quick password generator I spun up that creates memorable passwords using simple words, numbers, and symbols. No more indecipherable strings, just secure and practical passwords you can actually recall.

## Why did I make this?

I hate passwords that look like a word-vomit of characters that my brain refuses to read, let alone remember. A password manager is an elegant solution, but let's be real, do you care to use one for more mundane (yet just as important) sites like your Tesco Clubcard login?

If you're anything like me, probably not. And it would be nice to have an easy to remember password of 3 simple words (and a few numbers and symbols for good measure).

Plus, you can create mnemonics to make them even easier to recall. Say your password is `"PinkAlienBoss35$"`- my mind immediately goes to a middle-aged alien manager with vibrant pink skin, only working for the money. Memorable, right?

## Why create a bespoke solution? Surely there are others out there?

You would be right to say that, but I created this solution because those often use complicated words together and randomly sprinkle complicated symbols and numbers in the mix, which just isn't practical all the time. Say you want to set up an Active Directory account for a new user and need a secure one-time password (which they will change on their first login) without putting them through the strenuous ordeal of typing out `"J7%U=c;[>AO1y|4Sv="`- that's where my solution is a good fit!

## Feedback & Improvements

This is something I put together very quickly and is naturally not the most elegant solution. I'm happy to receive feedback, improvements or criticism (if you catch me on a good day). Feel free to reach out!
